title: Userful windbg commands

Take a note of some userful windbg commands that are hard to remember!

```
bp kernel32!CreateFileW "r $t0 = poi(@esp + 4); as /mu ${/v:filename} @$t0; .block {.if ($spat(\"${filename} \", \"*.txt \")) {kb;} .else {gc;}}"
```

note:  
break into debugger when the process opens or creates a file with a *.txt* file extension.
